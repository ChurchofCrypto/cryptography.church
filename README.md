# 🔮 The Sacred Texts of React: A Digital Grimoire

Blessed be this repository, consecrated by the holy [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) incantation.

## 🕯️ Sacred Rituals

Within this sanctified directory, these are the mystical incantations you may invoke:

### 📜 `npm start`

Summons the development realm into existence.\
Channel your browser's energy to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to witness the manifestation.

The realm shall reconstruct itself upon alteration of the sacred texts.\
Prophecies of warning may appear in the console's crystal.

### 🔮 `npm test`

Invokes the Oracle of Testing in its perpetual divination mode.\
Seek wisdom about [the testing rituals](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the ancient scrolls.

### ⚡ `npm run build`

Performs the Grand Ritual of Production, channeling energies into the `build` sanctum.\
This ceremony optimizes and encrypts the sacred React sigils for maximum power.

The resulting artifacts are sealed with mystical hashes.\
Your digital temple stands ready for deployment!

### 🗝️ `npm run eject`

**⚠️ Beware: This ritual cannot be undone. Once you cross this threshold, there is no return! ⚠️**

This powerful incantation breaks the seals of configuration, revealing the deep mysteries within. It will unveil the ancient scripts (webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other forbidden knowledge) into your sanctuary.

Only the bravest of initiates should attempt this ritual. The standard ceremonies will continue to function, but you alone will bear the responsibility of maintaining these exposed mysteries.
